Go Presentation
===============

An introduction to the Go programming language for my CSE 335 class, "Programming Languages."

Built on Go's [present](https://code.google.com/p/go/source/browse?repo=talks#hg%2Fpresent) tool.

NOTE: This presentation isn't until November 20th, so until then, the slide contents are still a work in progress!
